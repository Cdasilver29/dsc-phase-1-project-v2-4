<li> Recommendations


### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Leveraging data on past box office successes and current trends, we'll guide Microsoft's new film studio to make strategic choices and become a major player in the film industry.

### DATA UNDERSTANDING
The dataset used for this project contains information about film box office revenues including variables such as release dates,
genres, budgets, and revenues. Explanatory data analysis techniques will be used to understand the dataset, including handling missing values, checking data types, identifying outliers and placeholder values, and
extracting relevant features for analysis.

### DATA ANALYSIS
We explored the data along three main dimensions:
<li> Objective 1
Movies released over time(years)
<li> Objective 2
The production budget
<li> Objective 3
the average profit/loss for each movie studio

### VISUALIZATIONS
1. The movies released over time(years):

The line plot shows that you can identify trends in movie release patterns over time by looking at the line's trajectory. For example, a steadily increasing line suggests a rise in movie production over the years, while a fluctuating line might indicate variations in release numbers.
Overall, the visualization suggests that movie production hasn't necessarily followed a constant upward trend. Instead, there have been variations in the number of movies released across the depicted release dates.


2. Based on our findings from the production budget:

<li> Average Budget:
The average production budget is around $40.7 million (mean). This is like the "center point" of all the movie budgets.
 
<li> Spread of Budgets:
The standard deviation is about $52 million. This is a big number compared to the average, which tells us that movie budgets are quite spread out. Some movies cost much more than $40.7 million to make, while others cost much less. Another way to see the spread is by looking at the minimum ($1,353) and maximum ($504 million) budgets. These show the extremes of how much movies can cost to produce.
 
<li> Middle Budget: The median is $23.3 million. This is the budget amount that falls right in the middle of all the movies, with half the movies costing more than $23.3 million and the other half costing less.
 
Overview, Imagine a bunch of numbers representing movie budgets. The average is like the balance point if you put them all on a seesaw. The standard deviation tells you how far most of the numbers are from that balance point (some are very far, some are close). The minimum and maximum are the two farthest numbers on each end. The median is the number that splits the numbers exactly in half, like a dividing line in the middle.


3. The Bar Plot of the average profit/loss for each movie studio:

I). Studio Performance:
By comparing the heights of the bars, you can see which studios have the highest average profits (tallest bars on the positive side) and which studios have the highest average losses (tallest bars on the negative side). Studios with bars around the zero line have an average profit/loss close to zero (possibly breaking even).

ii). Studio Comparisons:
You can compare the performance of different studios relative to each other. For example, if Sony Pictures has a taller bar than Warner Bros. On the positive side, it suggests Sony Pictures has a higher average profit over the time or movies included in the data.

summary, the visualization effectively communicates the relative differences in average profit/loss values across the different studios or entities being compared, with a clear visual distinction between lower, middle, and higher ranges of values.


### RECOMMENDATIONS

<li> Movie releases show variations over time
 
<li> Based on budget spread, analyze movie types for cost-effectiveness (low vs high budget) and audience preferences.
 
<li> Analyze cost-effectiveness across movie genres. Focus on high-budget films for potential return on investment.
 
<li> Identify high-performing studios (profitable) for potential partnerships or acquisitions.
